    "\n",
    "**I am recommending the Anaconda/Miniconda method for running Jupyter Notebook**. \n",
    "\n",
    "On my machine (iOS Sonoma, M2 pro), there is a massive speed advantage to running the code in the conda environment.\n",
    "The package versions seem the same so there is presumably a big difference in the underlying optimization. \n",
    "Since conda was designed with data science libraries libraries in mind,the fact that conda packages are often more optimized than pip for scientific computing, reduced execution is expected. \n",
    "Conda has MKL (Math Kernel Library) optimized packages for many scientific libraries like NumPy, SciPy, etc., \n",
    "which can significantly improve performance for certain operations. If you wish to follow this advice then skip straight to B2\n",

    "## A. Check if Python is Installed\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine if Python is installed on your system and to check its version, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open your Terminal**:\n",
    "   - On Windows: Search for command prompt or PowerShell in the start menu.\n",
    "   - On MacOS: Press `cmd + cpace` to open spotlight search and type 'terminal'.\n",
    "   - On Linux: Search for terminal in your applications menu or press `ctrl + alt + T`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check Python version**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python --version\n",

    "## <center>Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)<center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a statistical method used for estimating the parameters of a model. Given a statistical model with some unknown parameters, MLE aims to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function. The likelihood function measures how well the model explains the observed data. Stages involved in MLE:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Defining the Model:**\n",
    "   - Statistical model represented by a probability distribution that is defined by some parameters. This could be a normal distribution, Poisson distribution, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Likelihood Function:**\n",
    "   - The likelihood function is defined as the probability of observing the given data as a function of the parameters of the model. \n",
    "   - Mathematically, it can be written as $ L(\\theta | X) $, where $ \\theta $ represents the parameters, and $ X $ represents the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Maximization:**\n",
    "   - Find the values of the parameters that maximize this likelihood function. In other words, find the values of $ \\theta $ that make the observed data most probable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Log-Likelihood:**\n",
    "   - Often, it is mathematically easier to work with the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, known as the log-likelihood. \n",
    "   - Taking the logarithm simplifies the mathematics (turns products into sums) and doesn’t change the location of the maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Optimization:**\n",
    "   - Optimization techniques, such as gradient descent, are used to find the values of the parameters that maximize the log-likelihood.\n",
    "   - The first derivative (slope) of the log-likelihood is set to zero, and solving this equation gives the maximum likelihood estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a sample of data $ X = \\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\} $ from a normal distribution with unknown mean $ \\mu $ and known variance $ \\sigma^2 $. The likelihood function is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L(\\mu | X) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x_i - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the natural logarithm (log-likelihood) gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log(L(\\mu | X)) = -\\frac{n}{2} \\log(2 \\pi \\sigma^2) - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(x_i - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- MLE finds the parameter values that make the observed data most probable under the assumed model.\n",

    "- MLE is widely used in various statistical models and machine learning algorithms for parameter estimation.\n"

    "\n",
    "### 1. **Penalization of Model Complexity:**\n",
    "   - **BIC and AIC:** Both criteria penalize model complexity. They help in avoiding overfitting by penalizing models with more parameters.\n",
    "   - **Sum of Squares:** SS does not penalize model complexity. A model with more parameters might fit the data better by capturing the noise as a pattern, leading to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Model Comparison:**\n",
    "   - **BIC and AIC:** They allow for the comparison of non-nested models, providing a means to select the best model among a set of candidates.\n",
    "   - **Sum of Squares:** It’s primarily a goodness-of-fit measure and does not facilitate model comparison directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Information Loss:**\n",
    "   - **BIC and AIC:** They estimate the loss of information when a particular model is used to represent the process generating the data. Lower values indicate less information loss.\n",
    "   - **Sum of Squares:** SS is a measure of the discrepancy between the observed and predicted values but does not account for information loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Asymptotic Consistency:**\n",
    "   - **BIC:** BIC is consistent, meaning it will select the true model as the sample size approaches infinity (if the true model is among the candidates).\n",
    "   - **AIC:** AIC is not always consistent, but it tends to be more efficient with smaller sample sizes.\n",
    "   - **Sum of Squares:** SS does not have this property.\n",

    "### 5. **Applicability:**\n",
    "   - **BIC and AIC:** They are applicable in broader contexts and are used for model selection in various statistical and machine learning models.\n",

    "    - `baseline`: if True then uses all values are zeroed to the baseline (average of all given values before stim_time)\n",
    "    - `time`: if True then takes first column as time. Stim_time must be the time in this column that stimulation occurs. If this column is present and starts at t = 200 ms and stim occurs 100 ms after this then stim_time = 300. If time is False then program will create a time vector based on number of samples and dt and will assume time starts at t = 0. In this example stim_time is relative to t[0] i.e. stim_time = 100 ms\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Outputs:**\n",

    "    - `x`: array represents time\n",
    "    - `y`: array represents response obtained from df above; for nth column in df y = df.iloc[:, n-1].values\n",
    "    - `criterion`: defaults to None, If criterion = 'BIC' or 'AIC' then returns Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), respectively. In a similar manner to the sum of the squares of the residuals ('sum of squares'), lower values indicate a better fit. Has the advantage over 'sum of squares' that it can be used to compare fits that arise from models with different numbers of fitted parameters (e.g. one or sum of two product fits)\n",
    "    - `plot`: if True (default) then returns a plot showing original response in grey with fits superimposed \n",
    "    - `initial_guess`: defaults to None. If None then function should calculate appropriate starting values; if provided, only useful if start_method='LS'. Use in form initial_guess=[70,3,7,70,6,100] where values are estimates for ['A1', 'τ1', 'τ2', 'A2', 'τ3', 'τ4']. In general the solution is usually better if set to None.\n",
    "    - `start_method`: can be set to 'LS' for least squares. This option can be further altered by changing p0_algorithm. Other options are 'DE' for differential evolution and None. If None then takes initial random starting values and does 'MLE' without the intermediate step to refine the starting values. The latter can be considered a pure MLE method whereas setting start_method to either 'LS' or 'DE' is a hybrid. Obviously, if do not want MLE, this function also provides the (start) values obtained for this fitting provided start_method is either 'LS' or 'DE'. \n",
    "    - `percent`: default set to 80%. If start_method='DE' or 'LS' + initial_guess = None then if percent = 80, function calculates 'rough' initial starting values based on the amplitude and the 20-80% rise and 80-20% decay times. These are then fed into a separate function to calculate 'good' starting values using 'LS' or \"DE' curve fitting.\n",
    "    - `dp`: number of decimal results are returned to; default is 3\n",
    "    - `maxfev`: default is 100000; maximum number of iterations that the algorithm should run to try and find the parameter values that minimize the difference between the predicted and actual values (i.e., that best fits the data)\n",
    "    - `p0_algorithm`: by default set to 'trf'. When using least_squares to get starting values (i.e. start_method='LS'), least_squares will use the Trust Region Reflective algorithm, which is a derivative-free algorithm designed for solving nonlinear least squares problems. This algorithm combines the trust region method with a reflective strategy to handle both bound and unbound constraints on the variables. Other options include 'lm' and 'dogbox'\n",
    "    - `cv`: the cv or coefficient of variation is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation ($\\sigma$) to the mean ($\\mu$). The initial estimate for the starting values is based on response amplitude, 20-80% rise and 80-20% decay times. These values are used to create a lognormal distribution of starting values $ \\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\log(1 + (\\text{cv}^2)) } $ and $ \\mu = \\log(x) - 0.5\\sigma^2 $ where x is the parameter being randomized. A lognormal distribution was chosen because it ensures starting values cannot be negative. \n",
    "    - `N`: by default set to 30. N is the number of randomized starting values that are used to initialize the fits. if N > 1 then the function will compare solutions to determine the fit with minimised sum of squares. The greater N, then the higher the probability that the presented solution represents the best solution and not just a local minimum. With randomized starting values, the optimization algorithm may find different local minima in different runs. Setting N in the range 10 to 30 represents a good comprise between finding the best fit and function efficiency.\n",
    "    - `slow_rise_contraint`:  default is True. If True then MLE rejects any solutions with underlying fits can comprise the fastest rise combined with the slowest decay and vice versa. If True then guarantees the 'fast' fittted response will have the faster rise AND decay and the slow component the slower rise AND decay\n",
    "    - `rise`: The function is designed to return time constants related to exponential rise and decay (either as $ {\\tau}rise $ and ${\\tau}decay$ or ${\\tau}1$ and ${\\tau}2$; nb ${\\tau}decay = {\\tau}2)$. Neither $ {\\tau}rise $ or ${\\tau}1$ truly define rise time and both require careful interpretation. As an alternative, the function will also return the % rise and decay times. Default setting is $\\text{rise} = [0.2, 0.8]$ which will determine the 20 - 80% rise time.\n",
    "    - `decay`: Similarly to rise above, the default for this input is $\\text{default} = [0.8, 0.2]$ which returns the 80 - 20 % decay time\n",
    "    - `kinetics`: Default for kinetics is 'solve'. If using 'solve', the function solves an equation iteratively to determine rise, decay time constants;  area under the fit is calculated using the exact form of the equation given above. In practice, calculating rise and decay uses 'fsolve' from 'scipy.optimize' a numerical root-finding algorithm with estimated starting values. If set to 'fit', the function determines rise, decay and area from the underlying fits. If one fit is especially slow, 'solve' method will be more accurate.
